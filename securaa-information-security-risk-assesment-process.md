    style J fill:#ffebee
    style K fill:#fff8e1
    style L fill:#e8f5e8
    style M fill:#f3e5f5
```

#### Qualitative Assessment
- Descriptive risk scenarios and impact analysis
- Expert judgment and stakeholder consultation
- Risk matrices for likelihood and impact scoring
- Suitable for strategic and operational risks

#### Quantitative Assessment
- Mathematical models and statistical analysis
- Asset valuation and loss calculations
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) calculations
- Suitable for financial and technical risks

### Risk Calculation Formula

**Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact × Asset Value × Threat Capability**

Where:
- **Likelihood**: Probability of threat occurrence (1-5 scale)
- **Impact**: Consequence severity if risk materializes (1-5 scale)
- **Asset Value**: Criticality and value of affected assets (1-5 scale)
- **Threat Capability**: Sophistication and resources of threat actor (1-5 scale)

### Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Score | Risk Level | Description | Action Required |
|------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 81-100 | **Critical** | Immediate threat to business operations | Immediate action within 24 hours |
| 61-80 | **High** | Significant risk requiring prompt attention | Action within 1 week |
| 41-60 | **Medium** | Moderate risk requiring planned response | Action within 1 month |
| 21-40 | **Low** | Minor risk with acceptable impact | Action within 3 months |
| 1-20 | **Very Low** | Minimal risk with negligible impact | Monitor and review quarterly |

## Risk Identification Process

### Asset Inventory and Classification

#### Step 1: Asset Identification
Maintain comprehensive inventory of all information assets:

**Information Assets:**
- Customer data and personally identifiable information (PII)
- Intellectual property and trade secrets
- Financial records and business intelligence
- System configurations and security credentials
- Source code and technical documentation

**Technology Assets:**
- Servers, workstations, and mobile devices
- Network infrastructure and security appliances
- Cloud services and virtual environments
- Applications and software licenses
- Backup systems and disaster recovery resources

**Process Assets:**
- Business processes and workflows
- Security procedures and policies
- Change management processes
- Incident response procedures
- Training and awareness programs

#### Step 2: Asset Classification
Classify assets based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements:

| Classification | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability | Examples |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Highly sensitive | Mission critical | 99.9% uptime | Customer PII, payment data |
| **High** | Sensitive | Important | 99% uptime | Business intelligence, source code |
| **Medium** | Internal use | Standard | 95% uptime | Internal documentation, logs |
| **Low** | Public | Non-critical | 90% uptime | Marketing materials, public info |
