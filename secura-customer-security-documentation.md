// Credential encryption service (securaa_lib)
func CredentialsEncrypt(stringToEncrypt string, key string) (string, error) {
    origData := []byte(stringToEncrypt)
    k := []byte(key)
    block, err := aes.NewCipher(k)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    blockSize := block.BlockSize()
    origData = PKCS7Padding(origData, blockSize)
    blockMode := cipher.NewCBCEncrypter(block, k[:blockSize])
    crypted := make([]byte, len(origData))
    blockMode.CryptBlocks(crypted, origData)
    return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(crypted), nil
}
```
